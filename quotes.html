<h3> Abstract </h3>

<p>The research paper will discuss the background and subtypes of schizophrenia which are paranoid, catatonic, residual, disorganized, and undifferentiated. However, since there are many similarities between these types, the two subtypes will be compared and contrasted. It will also include information about how the damage to brain chemistry harms cognition, making them lose awareness of themselves. Schizophrenia is difficult to locate since it has various subtypes since the individuals exhibit many behaviors that make each case unique. There are positive and negative symptoms 
caused by the lack of motor control and increased parietal cortex activity. 
The development of the symptoms is caused by the dysfunction of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex caused in paranoid schizophrenic patients. 
Undifferentiated schizophrenic patients have decreased function in the temporal-hippocampal, which hinders their memory and attention. It is essential to raise awareness of schizophrenia since it’s
difficult to think of proper diagnostic criteria and support for the individuals inflicted with schizophrenia. In order to improve the conditions for the betterment of the patients, it is essential to understand the neurology and the 
harmful effects of schizophrenia to give them hope for recovery.</p>

<h3> Orgin of Schizophrenia</h3>

<p>It was simply called "adolescent insanity," not investigating it further. However, that was soon changed from Emil Kraepelin's proposal by integrating catatonic 
syndrome and hebephrenia naming his idea "dementia praecox." The name originated from his observations of noticing the pattern of clinical cases with decline in cognition and behavior, 
having classifications for the different cases:</p>

<p>Kraepelin acknowledged the diversity of the clinical pictures subsumed under dementia praecox and articulated nine different clinical forms. 
He created a model but doubted its validity. Kraepelin didn’t have an 
official diagnosis for dementia praecox since he formed naturalistic 
descriptions of the clinical observations from the patterns he noticed.</p>

<h3> The Perspective on Climate Change </h3>

<p>However, the government could not take appropriate actions since they are considering the economic costs of 
investing in handling climate change. The government thinks the capitalistic side 
applies to the phrase “benefits outweigh the costs.” For example, Australia was the first country that displayed implementing a national carbon tax failed to economic challenges 
<q>According to the Institute for Energy Research, the lofty economic costs of the carbon tax included: 
the loss of 80 jobs, a 16-19% increase in electricity rates, and a net loss of $4.38 billion to the Australian government</q> (Park 2015).</p>
