<title> THE BLOSSOM OF FRIENDSHIP! </title>

<h4> Story at the bottom: </h4>

<p> There was a young girl with black hair and blue eyes wearing her royal blue dress adorned with white crystals. Her face was elegant and innocent. 
She had double eyelids along with a a V-shaped jawline and pale skin that showed her tiredness. 
Her knees were touching the couch to have the height to stare at the window covering most of the wall. 
Her saddened eyes were staring down at the children soaking themselves in the rain jumping on the puddles with laughters of joy with their friend. 
Her heart was continuously stabbed with jealousy wanting to have the same experience but all she could do was sigh and watch them. 
“This is going to be one boring day.” She muttered with frustration. </p>

<p> She was starting to daydream about experiencing the joy with others which made her feel worse but she couldn't contain her desires. She had to show them somehow even if it was simply on her mind. 
However, it was cut short from the knock on the door. Her heart jumped and frantically she immediately sat down normally aligning her legs with a duchess slant while her hands were on her lap. 
She coughed to clear her voice. “Come in.” Her voice sounded childlike but maintained some level of authority from the smoothness of her enunciations. </p>
